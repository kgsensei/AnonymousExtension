# Anonymous Extension

Anonymous Extension is a kgsensei project and is Copyright &copy; of kgsensei 2024.

## Overview:

AnonymousExtension is a Edge and Chrome browser extension designed to make the internet a safer place for you. I was browsing the internet recently and looking at the crazy amount of trackers in some websites, there are like 60 in some websites alone... Like why? So I decided to build this web extension to block trackers, ip grabbers, and some other dangerous websites I know about.

It's really simple and easy to use, a true plug and play extension!

## New in v5

Anonymous Extension v5 features a new icon, UI, and block list. We've expanded upon our previous list by hundreds. We also added a script to remove any duplicate sites so we save resources. Enjoy!
